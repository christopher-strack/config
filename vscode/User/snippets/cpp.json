	// Place your snippets for cpp here. Each snippet is defined under a snippet name and has a prefix, body and 
	// description. The prefix is what is used to trigger the snippet and the body will be expanded and inserted. Possible variables are:
	// $1, $2 for tab stops, $0 for the final cursor position, and ${1:label}, ${2:another} for placeholders. Placeholders with the 
	// same ids are connected.
	// Example:
	"Ableton Copyright Header": {
		"prefix": "copyright",
		"body": [
			"// Copyright: 2018, Ableton AG, Berlin. All rights reserved.",
		],
		"description": "Add the copyright header"
	},
	"Ableton Disable Warnings": {
		"prefix": "disable_warnings",
		"body": [
			"ABL_DISABLE_WARNINGS",
			"$0",
			"ABL_RESTORE_WARNINGS",
		],
		"description": "Disable warnings for a section (i.e. third party headers)"
	}
